## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Personalized customer emails based off marketing analytics is a winning formula for many digital companies, and this is exactly the         initiative that the leadership team at DVD Rental Co has decided to tackle!

We have been asked to support the customer analytics team at DVD Rental Co who have been tasked with generating the necessary data points required to populate specific parts of this first-ever customer email campaign.

We will be using SQL to solve the problems faced by the analytics team and fullfill the requirements for the email marketing template.

## üéØ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

The following email template has been shared to us by the marketing team at DVD Rental Co. They need our help in order to start a personalized marketing campaign.

For each customer, we need to find the top 2 categories based on their past rental history.

</p>

### Requirement 2Ô∏è‚É£ <a name = "requirement_2"></a>

<hr>

Next, for each of the top 2 categories, we need to recommend 3 popular films which the customer hasn't watched. Even if there is atleast 1 film that can be recommended, it's fine with the marketing team.

### Requirement 3Ô∏è‚É£ & 4Ô∏è‚É£ <a name = "requirement_3&4"></a>

<hr>

Lastly, for the top 2 categories, we need to provide some individual customer insights. 

> For the 1st category, the marketing requires the following insights (requirement 3):

1. How many total films have they watched in their top category?
2. How many more films has the customer watched compared to the average DVD Rental Co customer?
3. How does the customer rank in terms of the top X% compared to all other customers in this film category?

> For the second ranking category (requirement 4):

1. How many total films has the customer watched in this category?
2. What proportion of each customer‚Äôs total films watched does this count make?

### Requirement 5Ô∏è‚É£ <a name = "requirement_5"></a>

<hr>

Lastly, we need to identify the favourite actor of the customer along with the total films they have watched in which their favourite actor has starred. Also, we need to recommend upto 3 films that the customer hasn't watched so far and make sure to exclude the films that we have already recommended in the above sections.
